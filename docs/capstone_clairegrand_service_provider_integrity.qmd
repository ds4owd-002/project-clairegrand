# Introduction

To reach national policy objectives for water and sanitation service
delivery and SDG6, water service providers globally must increase
service coverage and service quality in the face of growing challenges
related to financing, population growth, and climate change. To enable
these evolutions, there is high interest, particularly from
policy-makers, regulators, and sector analysts, in understanding the
drivers of performance of service providers. National and global utility
benchmarking processes have been used widely for this, to assess the way
service providers operate, and to orient sector reforms.

Water sector utility benchmarking is now evolving in part in response to
two developments:

-   First, the recognition that performance is affected by governance
    issues and corruption, and the related evidence that anti-corruption
    and integrity management can support utility performance
    (Barreto-Dillon, et al., 2018; WIN, 2021; IDB, 2024).

-   Second, growing criticism of the limits and bias in major utility
    benchmarking tools focusing primarily on efficiency, to the
    detriment of distributional equity (Bhatt, 2024).

There is a need for better tools that can support service provider
performance for integrity, equity, sustainability, and resilience. Local
context highly influences which practices are possible and effective for
different utilities. Still, there are some indications that there are
patterns in how good governance and integrity practices are implemented
in organisations in the water and sanitation sectors and that
benchmarking can be useful.

Major utility benchmarking tools such as Aquarating and NewIBnet
recently introduced new process indicators focusing on management
practices (in 2022 and 2023 respectively). There is however limited data
available on their use. The Water Integrity Network (WIN) also developed
a set of indicators to assess integrity management practices of service
providers and support planning for integrity risk management.

This analysis aims to examine anonymised data from applications of the
Water Integrity Network tool since 2018, to understand patterns of use,
possible resistance and challenges to assessing integrity practices, and
trends in integrity management practices.

# Methods

WIN developed integrity indicators for utilities from 2018 onwards with
support from the Inter-American Development Bank and in partnership with
the Consortium for Water Integrity in Latin America (with SIWI and
cewas). This set of indicators is sometimes referred to as the Utility
Integrity Assessment. It is part of WIN's InWASH integrity management
toolbox for water and sanitation service providers and it is also
available separately as an online survey.
