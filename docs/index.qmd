## Project description

Review of integrity practices of water and sanitation service providers,
using an assessment tool and data by the Water Integrity Network. The
key questions the assessment is aiming to answer are:

-   is there significant variation in the practices of service providers
    across the world?

-   are there major trends, strengths, and weaknesses?

-   are there regional trends?

-   do scores differ based on the type of utility, the way the the
    survey was taken, or within utilities (over time or between
    indivdual survey takers)

-   what is the impact of local regulatory requirements on survey
    results?
